# 2mb-random-objects

A simple app to generate four (4) types of printable random objects, which is equal to 2 MB in size.

## Getting Started

- At first you'll need to get the source code of the project. Do this by cloning the [2mb-random-objects](https://github.com/fatematzuhora/2mb-random-objects.git).

```
